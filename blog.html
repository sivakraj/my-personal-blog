                    <div class="card-header"><h3>Who are we?</h3></div>
                    <div class="card-para"><p>Are we just chemicals packed with bones, blood, muscles and hair? If so, the total cost of chemicals in our body would not be more than $30. Would any parent just sell their child for $30?
                        <br><br>
                        What's that in our body that develops love or hatred to fellow human beings or to other animals? If it's just chemicals, why is that killing a human being is considered a grave sin than destroying a car or killing an animal? If it's all chemicals, why isn't that scientists or doctors unable to inject proper chemicals and bring back a dead person alive?
                        <br><br>
                        All these suggest that, we're not simply this body made up of chemicals but something beyond. Something that is aloof from body but at the same time supplies necessary consciousness to drive the body.
                        <br><br>
                        Let's try to understand about that "something" with a simple analogy. When a person dies, the common word used to convey the death is, "so and so person passed away." The dead body or the person with whom we interacted just before the death is still lying there, then what has passed away? We can also see that the word "passed away" is not language specific for similar meaning phrase is used in all languages throughout the world.
                        <br><br>
                        It's easy to understand from above analogy that, that "somehting" which has passed away during death of a person is nothing but "soul."
                        <br><br>
                        The book "Bhagavad Gita" reverred as the best philosipical treatise describes the death as follows:
                        <blockquote class="blockquote" cite="https://vedabase.io/en/library/bg/2/22/">
                            <p>As a person puts on new garments, giving up old ones, the soul similarly accepts new material bodies, giving up the old and useless ones.</p>
                            <footer>â€”Bhagavad Gita, <cite>Chapter2, Verse 22</cite></footer>
                        </blockquote>

                    <div class="card-img"><img src="img/suffer.jpg" alt="Why do we suffer image" class="img-responsive"></div>
                    <div class="card-header"><h3>Why do we suffer?</h3></div>
                    <div class="card-para"><p>
                        Our sufferring is due to identification with this bag of chemicals called body. We're under the spell of maya which is defined as "that which is not."
                        <br><br>
                        Soul is defined as an eternal entity which is full of knowledge and  bliss. When that same soul gets encaged within this body, it's put into an incompatible condition and hence the suffering begins.
                        Soul thus entrapped within a particular type of body - may be a cat body, a dog body, an insect body, a human body based on his past deeds(karma) - wanders in this material world birth after birth.
                        <br><br>
                        So the condition is that the eternal soul is put into these differnt kind of bodies based on one's karma and it goes on and on and on perpetually. This is called cycle of birth and death.
                        <br><br>
                        For example, a person(soul) is in human body now and he is interested more in swimming. Assume that he's an olympic champion in swimming. Think about what will happen after his death. Since in the present life he's more interested in swimming and spent his whole life in swimming, after his death, he'll attain an aquatic animal body like a fish or a shrimp or a whale. Because that's what he is interested in and instead of using his human form of life usefully - for self realization - he was simply interested in swimming. Nature has already created a particular body for swimming - aquatics - and he gets it. Similarly a weight lifter will get an elephant or donkey's body in his next life and in this way it will go on and on, sometimes in human body sometimes in animal body and the cycle continues.
                        <br><br>
                        This viscious cycle of birth and death is what puts soul in deep suffering. Now the question is how do we get out of this cycle of birth and death? Read the next section to know more about this.

                <section class="blog-card card3" id="blog3">
                    <div class="card-img"><img src="img/solution.jpg" alt="Solution image" class="img-responsive"></div>
                    <div class="card-header"><h3>What's the solution?</h3></div>
                    <div class="card-para"><p>
                        The solution is simple. First, we need to stop identifying ourselves with the body and realize that we are something beyond this body called soul. And that soul transmigrates from one body to another at the time of death. All this we've seen briefly in the earlier sections.
                        <br><br>
                        Understanding soul is not complete without knowing the nature of soul. Now what does that mean? Take fire for instance. What's the nature of fire? The Nature of fire is to give heat and light. Whenever you light a fire, you immediately get heat and light. So heat and light is something inseparable from fire and that consititutes the nature of fire as well.
                        <br><br>
                        Second example is water, the nature of water is to be in liquid state and to flow.
                        <br><br>
                        Similary, the nature of soul is to love and serve. This we can understand easily as we're constantly in search of love. In childhood, we try to love our friends, toys etc. In youth, we try to find love with an opposite sex. Once married, we try to find love with our children. Mean time we may try to find love with nation and that results in serving nation, country, philanthropic work etc. This way it goes on and on in every stage of our life.
                        <br><br>
                        Our object of love may differ but the propensity to love and serve remains for that is the nature of soul.
                        <br><br>
                        Now, one inevitable problem with finding love in this world is that, it's not permanent. As we can see, at every stage the object of our love changes. Sometimes this change can happen due to the fact that the person or thing to which we find our love is not capable enough to reciprocate to our love properly. It's not the defect on the person or object but that's how the world is designed.
                        <br><br>
                        For example, we may love a person so dearly but if that person either dies or cheats us then we're baffled. When enough people cheat us then we may divert our love to pet animals like cats and dogs. Again same problem lies there too.
                        <br><br>
                        So we must know where to find our love and the only worshippable and lovable person is the Supreme Lord Krishna. The eternal soul in love and service with the Supreme lord is the perfect combination that will fullfill our nature to love and serve and it will go on and on eternally and blissfully.
