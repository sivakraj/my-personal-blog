# My Portfolio

This is my _first blog_ as part of my carrier sojourn towards the front end development. This blog site simply showcases a webpage where you'll get a chance to sneak-peak on the topics of self realization.

This webpage is created with two purposes, one is to provide knowledge on topics of self realization and other is to practice CSS Grid and Flexbox concepts.

### Getting Started

There are two methods for getting started with this repo.

#### Familiar with Git?
Checkout this repo using GIT enabled terminal by cloning it as follows:

```
> git clone https://github.com/sivakrajgithub/my-personal-blog.git

```

#### Not Familiar with Git?
Click [here](https://github.com/sivakrajgithub/) then download the .zip file.  Extract the contents of the zip file, then open the index.html file to view my blog site. All dependencies needed for web page display would also get downloaded along with the .zip file.
